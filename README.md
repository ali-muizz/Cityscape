# Summary of Program Functions

Upon running, a skyline of a city will display where the window lights for each building will be randomized. A car moves across the bottom of the screen, back and forth. Additionally, numerous UFOs move about randomly, resulting in them coliding into each other and slowing down or speeding up. Using arrow keys, the user can control one of the UFOs, and move around the city's sky. Once space bar is pressed, a beam of light is sent below the UFO, and if the car is hit by this beam, it will disappear.
